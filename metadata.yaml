description: "My Brilliant Career is a 1901 novel written by Miles Franklin. It is\
  \ the first of many novels by Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin (1879â€“1954), one\
  \ of the major Australian writers of her time. It was written while she was still\
  \ a teenager, as a romance to amuse her friends. Franklin submitted the manuscript\
  \ to Henry Lawson who contributed a preface and took it to his own publishers in\
  \ Edinburgh. The popularity of the novel in Australia and the perceived closeness\
  \ of many of the characters to her own family and circumstances as small farmers\
  \ in New South Wales near Goulburn caused Franklin a great deal of distress and\
  \ led her to withdrawing the novel from publication until after her death.\nShortly\
  \ after the publication of My Brilliant Career, Franklin wrote a sequel, My Career\
  \ Goes Bung, which would not be published until 1946.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
